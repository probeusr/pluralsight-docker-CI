# Test app for Pluralsight course

This is a quick and dirty test node.js app cobbled together for the purposes of demonstrating a basic CI/CD workflow with Docker Hub for a Pluralsight video training course..

## Instructions for use

All of the files included in the .zip file (available to Plus subscribers) should be unzipped into a new directory.

Initializing a Git repo and making a remote of it on GitHub are explained in Module 2 of the course.

The viewer should have Git installed and have a GitHub account.
